- 👋 Hi, I’m @barbravel93 and I'm from Asturias, Spain. I've studied a Philosophy Degree and a Master in Contemporary Culture Research before I became a data scientist.
- 👀 I’m interested in how programming can provide humanities with a more scientific status which allows us to understand better humankind.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on social science data based researching, ethics and I.A. and, also, I'll love to help in bigger projects that allows me to  improve my coding skills
at the same time I lend my writting and translation skills. Also I can be useful in giving a philosophical and sociological approach and analysis to your data.
- 📫 You can find me at barbravel93@hotmail.com. Tell me about your project and, if I think I can be helpful, I'll be glad to colaborate with you and your team!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @barbravel93 and I'm from Asturias, Spain. I've studied a Philosophy Degree and a Master in Contemporary Culture Research before I became a data scientist.
- 👀 I’m interested in how programming can provide humanities with a more scientific status which allows us to understand better humankind.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my programming skills and mathematical comprehension.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects, specially those ones that combinate social sciences and data analysis
- 📫 You can find me at barbravel93@hotmail.com. Tell me about your project and, if I think I can be helpful, I'll be glad to colaborate with you and your team!
